* Starting point was this d3 [Multi-Series Line Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3884955) example.
* I needed a good dose of the d3 [reference](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/API-Reference).
* The mental model for d3 is explained super well [here](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/).
* ES6 [Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/) for the sake of it.
* [Polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) because otherwise only at most 1/2 the world's browsers can see the page.
* BOM json API
* Mouse over [example](http://bl.ocks.org/WillTurman/4631136).
* Cors/cache proxy for BOM data (http server sample on dartlang site).
* Heroku + Dart [write up](http://blog.sethladd.com/2012/08/running-dart-in-cloud-with-heroku.html) from Seth Ladd.
* Sunrise & Sunset times in JS from [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc).
